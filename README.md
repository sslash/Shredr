##TODOS:
* Battles
    - Finish a battle - TODO STUFF
    - See through that advanced battles work now

    finish battles with winners:

        Battles should have a finished time. When on of the
        compellors logs in, system will check all their ongoing battles
        to see if any of them has timed out. In that case, the winner
        will be chosen, and battle set to finished. Both compellors
        will be notified. In the future, this will instead be done by
        a cronjob or similar

        WAYS TO WIN
        - Highest Vote
        - Not Reply

        PROMOTIONS
        - battle compellors are asked to vote on other battles.
        This leads those other battles' compellors to get current
        battle in their feed, in which they should vote on for extra
        credit. Extra credit leads to more XP and possibly new badges
